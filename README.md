# eCreatures
Interactive creatures on your desktop, made with Visual Basic .NET

- Project just started, so it's still just a proof of concept really.
- Messy code & files for now (but works!)
- Currently using random GIFs sourced from the internet, will eventually be replaced with custom animated 'things'.
